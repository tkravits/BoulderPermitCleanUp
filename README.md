### BoulderPermitCleanUp

This tool allows the user to select an excel sheet from 
which to import given permit information. The script then makes 
the necessary changes to the data and reformats the information. 
   
The result it three output files: an excel sheet with the permits 
that need to be worked, a text file in the correct format to be 
pulled into a database, and an excel sheet summarizing the information 
for the appraisers.
